ChatBot in Python – Learning from User Input (Autumn 2025)

This project was inspired by a tutorial on building a Python chatbot that learns from user input using JSON to store conversation history. The chatbot can remember previous interactions and improve over time based on user responses.

I followed and expanded on the tutorial to understand how chatbots process input, save conversation data, and generate context-aware replies. This helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, data handling, and basic AI logic.

🏆 Highlights

✅ Built using Python and JSON for data storage
 Chatbot “learns” by saving user conversations
💬 Handles dynamic responses via text-based input
 Practised importing modules, saving/loading data, and finding best matches
 Strengthened knowledge of logic, file handling, and pattern matching

💼 Key Skills Demonstrated

Python programming (loops, conditionals, file I/O)

JSON data storage and retrieval

Text-based user interaction

Logic-based pattern matching

Debugging and testing simple AI behaviour
